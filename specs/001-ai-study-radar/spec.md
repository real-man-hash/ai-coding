# Feature Specification: AI 学习伙伴雷达 (AI StudyMate Radar)

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-study-radar`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# 功能规格定义：AI 学习伙伴雷达（AI StudyMate Radar）"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - AI Knowledge Gap Analysis (Priority: P1)

A student uploads learning materials (text or OCR from images) and receives an AI-powered analysis identifying their knowledge gaps and learning blind spots with a visual radar chart.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - without gap analysis, the other features cannot function. It provides immediate value to users by identifying what they need to learn.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading sample learning content and verifying that the system generates a structured knowledge gap report with visual representation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has uploaded learning text content, **When** they request analysis, **Then** the system returns a knowledge gap report with identified blind spots
2. **Given** a user uploads an image with text, **When** OCR processing completes, **Then** the system analyzes the extracted text and generates a gap report
3. **Given** a user provides optional self-assessment data, **When** combined with AI analysis, **Then** the system produces a more accurate gap assessment

### User Story 2 - Memory Card Generation (Priority: P2)

A user selects topics from their knowledge gap analysis and the system automatically generates Q&A memory cards that can be exported or shared with study partners.

**Why this priority**: This builds on the gap analysis to provide actionable learning tools. It transforms identified gaps into concrete study materials.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting topics from a gap report and verifying that relevant, high-quality memory cards are generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a knowledge gap report, **When** they select specific topics, **Then** the system generates relevant Q&A memory cards
2. **Given** memory cards are generated, **When** a user requests export, **Then** the system provides Anki-compatible format
3. **Given** memory cards are created, **When** a user chooses to share, **Then** the cards are saved to a shared learning area

### User Story 3 - Study Buddy Matching (Priority: P3)

A user seeks compatible study partners based on their learning patterns, knowledge gaps, and preferences, receiving AI-powered matching recommendations.

**Why this priority**: This provides social learning value but depends on the previous features for accurate matching data. It's valuable but not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having user profiles with learning data and verifying that the system suggests appropriate study partners with matching scores.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has learning profile data, **When** they request study partner matching, **Then** the system returns a list of compatible users with match scores
2. **Given** matched study partners, **When** users connect, **Then** the system suggests relevant discussion topics based on shared knowledge gaps
3. **Given** study partners are connected, **When** they share learning materials, **Then** the system updates both users' learning profiles

### Edge Cases

- What happens when uploaded content contains no clear learning topics or is in an unsupported language?
- How does the system handle users with no previous learning history for gap analysis?
- What occurs when no suitable study partners are found for matching?
- How does the system handle users who opt out of data sharing for matching?
