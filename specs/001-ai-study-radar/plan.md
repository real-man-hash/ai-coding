# Implementation Plan: AI StudyMate Radar

**Branch**: `001-ai-study-radar` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-ai-study-radar/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

AI-powered learning gap analysis and study partner matching system that helps students identify knowledge blind spots, generate memory cards, and find compatible study partners through intelligent matching algorithms.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Next.js 14 (App Router)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, Drizzle ORM, MySQL, shadcn/ui, TailwindCSS, Recharts.js, 火山引擎 API  
**Storage**: MySQL database with Drizzle ORM for data persistence  
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application (responsive design for desktop and mobile)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms response time for 95% of requests, support 1000+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Privacy-first data storage (minimal anonymous data only), AI API rate limits  
**Scale/Scope**: 10,000+ users, 3 core modules, 4 main pages  

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **User-Centric Learning Experience**: All features prioritize learner outcomes and provide actionable feedback
✅ **AI-Driven Knowledge Extraction**: Core functionality powered by AI for accuracy and scalability  
✅ **Data Privacy & Minimal Storage**: Only essential anonymous data stored, no personal identifiers
✅ **Independent User Story Implementation**: Each module can be developed and tested independently
✅ **Performance & Scalability Standards**: Response time and accuracy targets defined
